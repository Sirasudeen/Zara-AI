## System Architecture

1. **Document Indexing and Retrieval**:
    - The RAG service maintains a vector store index, allowing it to fetch relevant context for user queries.
    
2. **Generative Response Creation**:
    - OpenAI’s language models are used to generate responses, blending fixed personality traits with dynamic, context-sensitive content.
    
3. **Caching Mechanism**:
    - Queries are hashed and stored in a cache to prevent repeated processing of similar questions, speeding up response time.
    
4. **Flask Routing**:
    - The RAG service has a single `/chat` route for receiving queries and returning structured responses in JSON format.
